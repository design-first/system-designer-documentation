[Design First](https://github.com/design-first) is a set of tools to help developers to design before coding. It contains:

 * **System Designer** a UI designer to create systems and
 * **[System Runtime](https://designfirst.io/systemruntime/),** a JavaScript library to run and manage systems.

> A system is an application: 
>- defined by a model,
>- composed by components and
>- reacts to events with actions that we call behaviors.

## Design First architecture

* System Designer **designs and bundles your system** into a [JSON](http://json.org) file and
* [System Runtime](https://designfirst.io/systemruntime/) **installs and runs this bundle** server and client side.
