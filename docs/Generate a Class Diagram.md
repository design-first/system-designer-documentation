You can generate a class diagram of your entire system and export it in *SVG*.

## View the class diagram

To generate a class diagram:
* just click on the corresponding button in the toolbar (the 5th button from the top)
* or type *Command* + *D* (on macOS) / *Control* + *D* (on Windows 10).

Then a new window will open and you will see the class diagram of your system.

You will be able to:
*  zoom in/out 
* or move the diagram to explore the model.

## Dynamic generation

If you work on your system when your class diagram window is still open, you will notice that the class diagram is generated everytime you update the schema or model of the system. So keep the class diagram window open, you will find this way of working very useful.

## Class diagram exportation

You can save the class diagram in *SVG* by clicking on the export button. 

> Remember that you export the class diagram at the zoom the diagram is. So it is generally better to export the diagram when diagram is at Zoom x1.
