## What we are and what is this document

System Designer is an IDE for designing systems. You can run it on your browsers, on your computers (*Windows*, *macOS* or *Linux*) or on your mobile devices (*iOS* or *Android*).

This document describes where your personal informations are saved and what we do to protect them.

## Do we save personal informations?

**No**.

## Are we sure of that?

Yes. Informations that are saved are only:
* your systems and
* your IDE preferences.

There is no tracker on System Designer, System Designer website and System Designer documentation website.

## So where these informations are saved?

 Systems data and IDE preferences are saved **locally on your machine**. We stored them in your [localstorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage/LocalStorage). 

**Your data stay on your machine** and are not send to a server. Some informations are encrypted like your GitHub token to be sure that these sensitive informations are not visible in clear in your localstorage.

>- on *macOS* you will find all your data here: *~/Library/Application Support/System Designer/*
>- on *Windows* you will find all your data here: *%APPDATA%\\System Designer\\*

## Can we prove that?

Yes. All the code used to build System Designer is [open source](https://github.com/design-first/system-designer). The code of System Designer website is also [open source](https://github.com/design-first/design-first.github.io). So there is a total transparency on the code that is executed on your machine.
